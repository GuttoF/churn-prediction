    "The Top Bank company operates in Europe with a bank account as the main product, this product can keep client's salary and make payments. This account doesn't have any cost in the first 12 months, however, after that time trial, the client needs to rehire the bank for upcoming 12 months and redo this process every year. Recently the Analytics Team noticed that the churn rate is increasing.\n",
    "\n",
    "As a Data Science Consultant, you need to create an action plan to decrease the number of churn customers and show the financial return on your solution.\n",
    "At the end of your consultancy, you need to deliver to the TopBottom CEO a model in production, which will receive a customer base via API and return that same base with an extra column with the probability of each customer going into churn.\n",
    "In addition, you will need to provide a report reporting your model's performance and the financial impact of your solution. Questions that the CEO and the Analytics team would like to see in their report:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  What is Top Bank's current Churn rate?\n",
    "2.  How does the churn rate vary monthly?\n",
    "3.  What is the performance of the model in classifying customers as churns\n",
    "4.  What is the expected return, in terms of revenue, if the company uses its model to avoid churn from customers?\n",
